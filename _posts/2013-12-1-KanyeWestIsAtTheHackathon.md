title: Kanye West is AT the @AngelHackNYC hackathon

---

Sonic Notify team is currently at the @AngelHackNYC hackathon. We thought with all the fun/sucess we are having with Retail beacon implemenations. Maybe there is a silly idea we can do, so we present the app **KANYE**

Application uses Sonic Notify beacons (BLE, iBeacon, AudioWatermark) to wake up the app in the background when you are in range of Kanye West. (Requires Kanye to be wearing specially made Bling Necklace/Beacon)

Get really close and the app unlocks special content,songs, videos etc. Kanye also has some "breadcrumb" beacons that he can leave in places he has been" So you walk into the 40/40 Club and your phone says "Kanye was here two nights ago and left a video for you"
