<p>Every time I go to pitch a new partnership or customer I feel like I&#8217;m telling them we&#8217;ve found life on Mars. When they first see Sonic they scratch their heads and say &#8220;Can you really do that?&#8221; Simple take away&#8230;.  new is hard to understand.</p>
<p>Innovation = understanding the difference between a progression, a disruption, and an earthquake. In this battle to promote understanding of a new technology I suggest dumbing it down as we have:</p>
<p>"Never before have you been able to communicate with someone in front of a store shelf, in front of a stage at a concert, or sitting on their couch in front of their television."</p>
