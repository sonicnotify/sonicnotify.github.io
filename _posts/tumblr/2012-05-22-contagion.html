<p>A bunch of us from the office decided to participate in the disrupt hackathon from saturday to sunday. Mostly because we thought it would be a good place to recruit, <a href="http://sonicnotify.com/jobs">did we mention we are hiring?????</a>. We decided when we got there to have some fun combining the sponsored api&#8217;s at the event and Sonic Notify. The result after 24 hours is</p>
<p>CONTAGION an iphone and web app which</p>
<p>gamifies and helps spread candid picture taking ( because people dont share enough.) </p>
<p>The basic premise is this. You start up the Contagion iphone app. You select the button to start a new contagion. This turns your phone into a transmitter of the Sonic Notify code which &#8220;infects&#8221; phones around you who also have the contagion app. Infected phones take a picture every few seconds and post to the cloud. The screen doesn&#8217;t allow for the selecting of your images, instead the shots are entirely candid and the view for the user is everyones photos in the contagion.</p>
<p>Now the cool part comes when the web app comes into play. Currently it just graphs vs time the photos taken for each contagion. But what we invisioned was a picture in which you could see each contagion geographically and then as one person from contagion A met with contagion B, the two contagions would merge and so would the photo streams. </p>
<p>So imagine you are at an event. You want to see whats happening in the front row or the balcony. You fire up Contagion and start a small pocket with the phones around you. But if a lot of people had the app, the contagion would spread throughout the space and create a whole snapshot of the event every few seconds.</p>
<p>We used Mobli for pictures, ATT Cloud Architect for the webapp, and City Grid for the local ads. A fun night. </p>
