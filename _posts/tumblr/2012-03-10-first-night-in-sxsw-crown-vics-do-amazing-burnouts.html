<p>We got to SXSW and the only car left was a white Crown Victoria. Because Jon rides everywhere in taxis back home in NYC. We felt right at home. You will notice the huge box, that comes later.</p>
<p>Driving in this beast down the road eating barbecue, wearing aviators, and looking out for breakfast tacos is the definition of great time. And also not related to Sonic Notify.</p>
<p>Jon and I setup the Sonic installation on Wednesday.</p>
<p>First came the blood pressure check, always a first step before manual labor.</p>

<p>Then unwrapping the box, yep its a giant plexiglass sonic bolt. Complete with flashing lights (555 timer + AC Relay, Sonic Notify builds everything electrical) and speaker.</p>

<p>The bolt has a Sonic Notify beacon inside. Step inside the red circle and you can receive a special url content. The content which you created and uploaded to a special feed site. Pretty cool.</p>
<p>The whole display just looks amazing and it is all because of JOB and Margaret. </p>

<p>Also throughout the FEED building art displays all Sonic Notified with cool content.</p>
<p>After a long night it was time to drive the Crown Vic back. Only to find out the best part of the night. The Crown Vics burnout ability. </p>
<p>Steps for Success</p>
<p>1. Stop at Stoplight in Austin after torrential rain storm (it never rains in austin, right)</p>
<p>2. Slam accelerator.</p>
<p>3. Car doesnt move, just sits that roaring. Awesome. </p>
