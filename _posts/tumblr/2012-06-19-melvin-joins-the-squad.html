<p class="MsoNormal">Melvin Rayappa is one of the latest additions to the Sonic Notify team. While his intentional humor leaves much to be desired, he more than makes up for it in his fanaticism towards the New York Mets and rapper Mike Jones.  Melvin “just graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Engineering and Public Policy with an additional minor in Robotics, and will be graduating with a masters in ECE from CMU in Spring 2013 with a focus in embedded systems and control systems.” Some know Melvin as the “Seductive MATLAB Master;” but what he truly is, other than a great all around guy, is a super proactive and intelligent hardware-and-software intern over at Sonic. He really likes food. </p>
