<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.8788758690934628"><span>One commercial which I liked recently was the Nissan commercial with all the gas powered devices that usually run on electricity: like the guy with the gas toothbrush, gas computer etc. I love it because I can almost imagine the glorious noise and clatter that would be the Sonic office if all the iMacs were churning along. </span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>But the commercial makes the point, imagine a world a different way. What I continuously think about is the world with the click versus the world without the click. Imagine a world where to check your email you clicked a button “Check Email.” What about phone calls? What if phones didn’t ring. Instead you had to be continuously polling to see if you had a phone call. Did a call come in? A call come in? A call come in? A call come in? A call come in? A call come in? …&#8230;</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>It&#8217;s ridiculous. You would occasionally check to see if you missed any calls. But by and large you wouldn’t use the phone. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The current Second Screen experiences are like a phone without a ringer, a world without pushes. Check in to a show. Press listen on my device. Launch an app. These are the kinds of things being asked of the consumer by the current Second Screen experience. As a consumer, you have already lost me. That’s why I think its critical that the Second Screen experience becomes a push experience. </span><br/><span></span><br/><span>So back to imagining a world. You are watching a DVR recording of the big bang theory on TBS and your iPad on the table buzzes. The iPad notificaiton states, “ who was Clerk Maxwell and is Sheldon correct about his creation of the laser” I pick up my iPad and now I am watching a short blurb video on Clerk Maxwell narrated by Sheldon. Engaging. Helpful. Like a phone that rings when you get a call. </span></strong></p>
