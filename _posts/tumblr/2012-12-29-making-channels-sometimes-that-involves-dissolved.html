<p>Read about the new 4.0 Sonic Notify? If you have you know it all about <a href="http://sonicnotify.com/channels.html">Channels</a>. Channels are the things ( both physical and software) which output the Sonic data. Some of our channels actually require some building of hardware!!!! </p>
<p>Sometimes the back bathroom in the office gets taken over by Chris and the result, dissolving copper off PCB stock. While we dont manufacturer the beacons in house, we do make plenty of sample, demo, and scratch beacons while finalizing the design. </p>

<p>And Lev spent the day putting the finish touches on the Sonic Mini Broadcaster shipment materials which clients will be receiving with their units. Lots of pictures of hardware.</p>
