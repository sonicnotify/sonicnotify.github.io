<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve come a long way from handing out promotional flyers in a giant NYCMate costume—I’ve been upgraded to Shake Shack delivery boy, a true honor. But seriously, that stuff tastes good. What was once known as Densebrain has evolved into Sonic Notify (check out what we do <a href="http://www.sonicnotify.com">here</a>.) Oh yeah, did I mention that lunch is on the house? My name is Lev Raslin and I started working at Densebrain during the last week of my junior year at college. As an intern, I wasn’t really expecting the wild ride that was soon to come. Dodgeball, nights at The Brass Monkey, my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday… Well that’s another story. Working at Densebrain was a truly expansive experience that put me side-by-side with some of the city’s brightest (and funniest) tech talent. Everyday was a (mostly pleasant) surprise; our adventures have helped build some close friendships. I’m excited to rejoin the team and contribute to Sonic Notify. It’s an exciting time to be involved in the tech industry, especially in NYC, in the heat of it all. Amongst the various things I’ll be doing is keeping everyone informed of daily funnies and oddities using our twitter account (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sonicnotify">@SonicNotify</a>), so keep your eyes peeled for those. Cheers, until next time.   </p></p>
