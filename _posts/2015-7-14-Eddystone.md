###Signal360 directly contributed to the development and release of the new Eddystone protocol

New York, NY July 14, 2015 -- Eddystone™, an open BLE beacon format from Google, for both Android and iOS, was created by Google with input from Signal360’s development resources and subject matter expertise in the mobile proximity-based marketing industry. Eddystone™ is a developer friendly scalable BLE beacon format to quickly deploy real-world context. Specifically, it is published openly on Github, supports multiple frame types to carry different frame loads in support of a variety of use cases, and is available on both Android and iOS.
Signal360’s beacons are now both Eddystone™ and iBeacon™ ready and Signal360 continues to offer the latest in mobile OS cross-platform support in both Android and iOS. Alex Bell, Signal360 Founder and CEO notes, “being asked to work with best in class developers from Google on this project was both an honor and reaffirming of the groundwork we have laid in the space. We were thrilled to be a part of this exciting development in the industry.”
Signal360 also offers support for Google’s Physical Web toolkit– an open source project created by Google to enable frictionless discovery of web experiences based on nearby objects. The basics of Physical Web work by broadcasting URLs via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packets. The URLs are scanned by mobile devices and are displayed to the user. Similar to beacon-triggered content in apps, all it takes is user engagement to interact with these notifications. For example, creating a smart parking meter that is BLE enabled– when a user approaches this meter, they have the option of paying seamlessly for parking via their mobile device, the experience triggered by the user's proximity to the parking meter.
Signal360’s unique combination beacons emit both the Signal360 patented inaudible audio tone as well as Bluetooth to reach devices, even with Bluetooth disabled. Signal360 beacons are still available in multiple form factors and now also include Eddystone™ and Physical Web support.
