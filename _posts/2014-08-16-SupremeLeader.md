Dear Supreme Leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea,

We at Signal360 have spent four years creating a platform for large enterprises to successfully deliver proximity marketing through our beacons. In our latest activation we helped the [University of Michigan delivery messaging and notifications](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/09/prweb12166161.htm) to the one hundred and twenty thousand fans at the “Big House.” But looking at Wikipedia I see that the “Big House” isn’t the biggest house, that honor belongs to the [Rungrado May Day Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungrado_May_Day_Stadium) in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. 

What am I proposing? We outfit Rungrado with Signal360 technology and delivery marketing messaging to your loyal citizens. Image citizens queuing to get in receive notifications with a program of todays special events. Passing the merchandise stand and a notification reminds them they can get a jersey or perhaps a Supreme Leader figurine. One lucky attendee could even get a free seat upgrade, get to sit in the top box.

Alex Bell
CEO
Signal360
