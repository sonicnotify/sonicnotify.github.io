title: We are here at the Sears Dev Hackathon
---

#SearsDevChallenge has started in NYC @GGoley CIO #Sears says he wants to increase app usage in store. Good, thats what we will do.

Sears Opening:
* We are a software company that has stores
* When consumers go to sears or use sears, they love us, and come back. Get users to interact with Sears
* We have a great app, but not a lot of downloads, give people a compelling reason to download and use the app in store

Apigee
* Used by all the big retails: they must be good!
* BAAS is free until you hit 10MM pushes a month.
* Win this prize by storing data in their database

Foursquare
* Everyone knows foursquare
* Lets you get pushes when one of your users checks in, didnt know that.

Mashery
* APIs for everything
* Beats api lets you stream songs, thats cool

Micello
* Was at Sears Hackathon in SF, now Sears is their biggest customer. 
* Make indoor maps, apps and sdk. We should work together

Twilio
* Voip, Text, etc
* I dont know how we are going to use this api, going to be a bit of a stretch.
