###Analytics and Connectivity Both Made Possible by Beacon Technology

Sacramento, CA (PRWEB) June 22, 2015 -- Red Hawk Casino, a premier Sacramento area casino, has received a variety of accolades throughout recent years, including recently being voted “Best Casino” for the fifth consecutive year on the KCRA A-List. Featuring a world-class gaming floor and ever evolving mobile technology, brand innovations now include a new mobile application that, amongst other features, includes cutting edge Sonic Audio Beacon technology (inaudible audio tone technology) + iBeacon™ compatibility from the Signal360 platform to enable special features for their guests.
A unique ‘offers’ section makes itself available to users only when they are on premises at the actual casino location. Red Hawk is also able to use metrics, by way of the Sonic Audio technology, to understand unique user flow and app usage on premises and how to better shape the on-site mobile marketing strategy moving forward using that data.
The flexible and comprehensive Signal360 platform, including beacon hardware, SDK and CMS, allows Red Hawk Casino to integrate necessary proximity based mobile marketing components into existing CRM and CMS systems while maintaining full content delivery and analytics functionality. “The beauty of our offering is the full platform,” says Alex Bell, Signal360 CEO. “From the differentiated Signal360 beacons that emit an Audio and BLE tone to our CMS that enables complex decisioning to ensure the delivery of impactful messaging or analytics, our complete platform makes proximity marketing quick and seamless.”
